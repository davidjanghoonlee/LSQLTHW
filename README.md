####Success
I succeeded in creating the skeleton of the program.
####Failure
I failed to figure out logic in the while-loop.
####Question
1. Why isn't the while-loop in my program repeating the wrong thing? It repeats "Invalid!" forever.

####Success
I fixed the previous problem of repeating "Invalid!" forever.

####Failure
My program wouldn't assign a new random integer to the variable without restarting the program.

####Question
How do I just declare a variable that does not have any value?
